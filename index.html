                            Knees is a pop rock band originating from San 
                            Francisco, California. The band consists a dynamic 
                            lineup featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, 
                            a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The band 
                            achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned 
                            act, drawing attention from their future manager. 
                            Having extensive experience working with both new and
                            seasoned acts, the manager was confident the band 
                            could succeed even further with more support, 
                            pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known 
                            record label.</p>
                        <p class="content_box_about_paragraphs_right">From there, 
                            the band has soared, gaining international recognition 
                            and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New 
                            fans immediately fell in love with the band's original 
                            and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the 
                            hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. 
                            Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are 
                            drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. 
                            The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio 
                            album, looking to be released in early 2024.
